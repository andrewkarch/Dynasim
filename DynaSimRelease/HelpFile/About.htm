This application allows the insertion of a system and the
ability to interact with the named variables the user
implements.
The system also allows this data to be graphically
represented on a line graph. Users can insert as many 
variables as they wish and choose how they interact with them.
Systems can both be saved and loaded. The application
saves these files as a .txt file for simplicity.

To get started on how to use this application, please see the left panel for details on some functionality.
