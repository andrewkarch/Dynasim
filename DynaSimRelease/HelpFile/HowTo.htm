<p>
The application allows users to implement a system and have it graphically represented. To get started  you can either load a
previously saved system, or you may input your own system.
</p>

<p>
To start putting in your own system,
 make sure you currently have the graph tab
selected.  You will notice a small table which allows
you to input data.
</p>

<p>
The column headings should read as followed:
<br>
<br>
<li> Variable Name
<li> Variable Quantity
<li>Rate of Change per Time Unit
<li>Quantity Birth Rate Per Time Unit
<li>Quantity Death Rate Per Time Unit
</p>

<p>
<b>Variable Name</b> will be the place where you want to name your variables (sheep, wolves, people, bacteria, etc.). These names will also be placed on the graph when you are ready to run your simulation.
</p>

<p> The next 4 columns will be expecting numeric quantities (integer or decimal).
</p>

<p>You may enter as many variables as 
necessary to complete your system.
</p>

<p>Once you have all of your data entered it is time to enter how your variables will interact with one another. You can navigate to this page by selecting the <b>Interactions</b> tab near the menu strip.
</p>

<p>In the <b>Interactions</b> tab you can specify how you want the named variables to interact with one another. You may also select the constants you
wish to include. A sample would be Sheep interact with Wolves with an effect of +3. To run the simulation and graphically represent it, you may either press the <b>Run Simulation</b> on the <b>Interactions</b> tab or you may press it on the <b>Graph</b> tab.
